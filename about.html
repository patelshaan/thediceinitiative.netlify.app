    <h2>About DICE</h2>
    <p>The DICE Initiative is powered by MIT LaunchX and based at College Park High School. Since our founding in 2017, we’ve evolved from a startup competition incubator to a thriving service-based entrepreneurship club.</p>

    <p>Originally, DICE prepared teams for the Diamond Challenge, encouraging hypothetical business proposals and competitive pitching. But when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, it changed how our student leaders saw the community around them.</p>
    <p>Instead of competing with imaginary businesses, our members began solving real problems for real organizations. That spirit of service has carried DICE into a new mission: to help students apply entrepreneurial skills while uplifting the Greater Houston area’s small businesses and nonprofits.</p>

    <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
    <p>DICE gives students a purpose. Every year, our members join teams that work directly with local clients — nonprofits, small businesses, or social entrepreneurs. Whether they’re helping develop websites, run social media campaigns, or improve operations, students gain first-hand experience and soft skills.</p>
    <p>Our teams are led by experienced peers — category leads — who help members navigate both technical and interpersonal aspects of client work. Everything is student-led, from the project management to the design choices.</p>

    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
    <p>With dozens of projects completed since 2020, we’re focused on scaling our impact while preserving the tight-knit collaboration that sets DICE apart. We aim to expand our reach, welcome new partners, and help our members discover the joy of creating meaningful change.</p>
